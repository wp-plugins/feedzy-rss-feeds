== Description ==

FEEDZY RSS Feeds is a small and lightweight RSS aggregator plugin. Fast and very easy to use, it allows you to aggregate multiple RSS feeds into your WordPress site through fully customizable shortcodes. 

The plugin uses the SimplePie CLASS php natively included in WordPress. SimplePie is a RSS parser that can read the information contained in a feed, process it, and finally display it.

FEEDZY RSS Feeds therefore supports any additional library and uses only the bare minimum to ensure good performance (minimalistic CSS + cache). 

You may use this plugin in your widgets and your pages and reuse the shortcode several times within the same page.

By activating this plugin, your cover picture will be inserted into your RSS feeds. By doing so, you'll make it will easier for external sites to retrieve images from your feeds.

Plugin is now using the TinyMCE API to improve UI and makes it easy to insert shortcodes!
